# Future Improvements of Sphere in a Maze

Possibilities:

- Add particles to the web version. Currently, particels take too much time to load on the exported web version. 
- Make variations for the levels more engaging. Add more levels (e.g. show the level for some time and solve the maze in the dark afterwards).
- Add arrows instead of words in controls scene.
- Beautify the UI.

Refactor the code ðŸ™‚:

- Add all the files to Scenes, Scripts and Assets folders.
- Extract repeated game elements to new scenes (floors, menu buttons).
