# Future Improvements of Sphere in a Maze

Possibilities:

- Add sound to the game.
- Make variations for the levels more engaging. Add more levels (e.g. show the level for some time and solve the maze in the dark afterwards).
- Solve shader stuttering in game loading and not in level loading.
- Add arrows instead of words in controls scene.
- Beautify the UI.
- Optimise shaders for the web.

Refactor the code ðŸ™‚:

- Extract repeated game elements to new scenes (floors, menu buttons).
- Move the player scene to Level directory (same goes for the level label).
